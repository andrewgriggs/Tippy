# Tip Calculator 

## *Andrew Griggs*

**Tippy** computes the tip and total amount for a bill. The app uses the base amount and tip percentage to calculate the amount owed, and it also describes the quality of service based on the tip.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can enter in a bill amount (total amount to tip on).
* [x] User can enter a tip percentage (what % the user wants to tip).
* [x] The tip and total amount are updated immediately when any of the inputs changes.
* [x] The user sees a label or color update based on the tip amount. 

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [x] Emojis appear beneath the tip description.
* [x] The user can select a number (1, 2, 3, 4) to split the bill, and the amount due is calculated.

## Notes

The code for changing the button color is very bulky/repetitive, but I was just trying to get it to work.

Options for splitting the bill are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4. I used buttons instead of an EditText because I wanted to try to get something different to work (app already uses EditText for the first field).
